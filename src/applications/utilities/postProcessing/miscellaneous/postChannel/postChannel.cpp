Application
    postChannel

Description
    Post-processes data from channel flow calculations

    For each time: calculate: txx, txy,tyy, txy,
    eps, prod, vorticity, enstrophy and helicity. Assuming that the mesh
    is periodic in the x and z directions, collapse Umeanx, Umeany, txx,
    txy and tyy to a line and print them as standard output.
