Caelus  is a software library suitable for numerical simulations of problems in Continuum Mechanics (CM), with many applications in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for a wide range of scientific and engineering applications across commercial and academic environments. Caelus was forked from OpenFOAM®, version 2.1.1 released by OpenFOAM® Foundation which is mainly a collection of libraries written in C++. Caelus is developed and maintained by Applied CCM Pty Ltd.

Being a derivative of OpenFOAM®, it is released under the GPL.

This documentation is split into three parts: a :ref:`tutorial <tutorial_manual>`, 
a :ref:`theory <theory_manual>` and a :ref:`validation <validation_manual>` manual.
New users should start with the :ref:`tutorial <tutorial_manual>` manual that provides examples of usage.
