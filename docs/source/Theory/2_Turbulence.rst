Theory: Turbulence Models
#########################

This section details the turbulence models implemented in Caelus |version|. Caelus |version| supports both steady-state and transient turbulence models. From an averaging point of view, Caelus |version| supports Reynolds averaged (RANS) and large eddy simulations (LES). The current focus of turbulence modelling in Caelus |version| is on incompressible flows. Future versions of Caelus will support compressible flows and appropriate compressible turbulence models.
